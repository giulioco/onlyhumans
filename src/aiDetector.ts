Return a JSON array with each tweet's ID and a boolean indicating if it's AI-generated. Example: {analysis:[{"id": "123", "isAIGenerated": true}, {"id": "456", "isAIGenerated": false}]}

  In general AI-generated tweets are:
  - Too perfect: No spelling or grammar mistakes, uses perfect grammar and sentence structure
  - Too positive: Uses overly positive language that doesn't sound natural or genuine
  - Too formal: Uses overly formal language that doesn't sound natural or genuine
  - Too repetitive: Repeats the same message over and over again
  - Not authentic: Doesn't sound like it's coming from a real person
  - If it uses "â€™" or "â€˜" instead of "'" or "â€™", it's most likely AI-generated


  Here are some examples of tweets that are AI-generated:
  - "localization is key, no doubt. gotta meet customers where theyâ€™re atâ€”language matters for business."
  - "That's awesome that you added ambient sound and used a compressor on the final mix to enhance the realism of the audio. It's great to see the effort you put into improving the quality of the sound. I agree that audio plays a significant role in minimizing the uncanny feeling..."
  - "This is amazing. A well-equipped gym alongside a program that pushes both mental and physical limitsâ€”thereâ€™s no better way to build resilience. It's inspiring to see a space that encourages growth in every way. Iâ€™m sure this is going to have a lasting impact on everyone involved."
  - "Looks like you accidentally upgraded from the 'freebie' to the 'splurge' option! Snapnames really knows how to surprise us with those hidden fees. Good luck negotiating that price down! ðŸ˜…"
